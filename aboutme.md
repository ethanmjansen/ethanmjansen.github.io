### Who am I?  
I am currently attending the Data Science Program at Lambda School. From 2013 - 2019 I have been working in Alaska seasonally as a tour guide and I even managed some smaller companies during my time there. I met my beautiful wife Mallory in January of 2018 and got married in December 2018. Mallory came to Alaska with me in the Summer of 2019 and shortly after we found out that she was pregnant by taking a pregnancy test on the side of the Alcan jut outside of Whitehorse, Yukon Territory. We are expecting our baby girl in March of 2020 and things are getting exciting.  

### What I'm reading  

Since I'm about to study Machine Learning and Predictive Modeling I have been working on getting through a tome of a book known as [GED](https://www.amazon.com/G%C3%B6del-Escher-Bach-Eternal-Golden/dp/0465026567), it has been a work in progress.
