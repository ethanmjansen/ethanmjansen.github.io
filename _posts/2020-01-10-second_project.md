This app accuratley predicts if you can approach a squirrel and have it run away or not. It took around 40 hours to complete and 
I am very happy with the end result. Up until this point this is the most intelligent thing I have ever created, a predictive model
with interactive capabilities. I hope you enjoy it as much as I do.
